The model variants are listed in the legends where db = design-based and the VAST models are listed by their error structure and the number of knots i.e., gamma_750 = a Gamma error structure with 750 knots. Figure 2.1: Design-based and VAST model estimates of survey biomass inputs. Shaded areas are 95% confidence intervals. Figure 2.2: Model estimated survey biomass. Figure 2.3: Model estimated spawning biomass. Figure 2.4: Model estimated total biomass. 2.3 Northern rockfish Examinations of different weightings for the survey index of abundance. Survey weight is in percent. The srv_wt_100_var is a full weight VAST survey with the variance doubled. Figure 2.5: Survey biomass estimates from differing survey index model weightings. db= design-based, srv = VAST. Figure 2.6: Spawning biomass estimates from differing survey index model weightings. db= design-based, srv = VAST. Figure 2.7: Total biomass estimates from differing survey index model weightings. db= design-based, srv = VAST.
